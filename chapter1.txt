Chapter 1: The Age of Hunters

The sky had not changed, nor had the earth beneath their feet, yet the world was no
longer the same. On an ordinary day, long ago, the gates appeared—vast, shimmering
fractures in reality that hovered in the air like wounds that refused to close. From them 
crawled creatures that did not belong to any myth humanity remembered, and with them
came a truth people could no longer ignore: mankind was no longer alone at the top.

At first, there was chaos.

Cities burned. Armies failed. Bullets meant nothing to claws that could tear steel apart, and 
bombs only delayed the inevitable. Humanity stood at the edge of extinction, staring into 
the darkness that poured from the gates. That was when something awakened within a 
small fraction of people—an unseen power sleeping deep in their souls.

They were called Hunters.

Some could crush stone with a single fist. Others bent flames, shadows, or healing light to 
their will. They were ranked, measured, and categorized, as if numbers could truly capture 
the weight of their power. Guilds rose like new empires, governments reshaped 
themselves around strength, and money began to flow toward those who could survive 
the gates and return alive.

Yet power was never evenly given.

For every S-rank hunter whose name shook nations, there were hundreds of low-rank 
hunters who risked their lives for scraps—people barely strong enough to be called 
hunters at all. They entered dungeons not as heroes, but as laborers of survival, clinging to 
hope with trembling hands.

Among them was a boy who stood at the very bottom.

He was weak—painfully so. His mana was low, his body fragile, and his name never 
appeared in headlines. Other hunters whispered it with pity or mockery, a label he had 
long since accepted. Still, every time a gate opened, he stepped forward. Not because he 
was brave, and not because he was strong, but because someone had to.

Each dungeon scarred him a little more.

Bones broke and healed crooked. Fear settled deep in his chest like a second heart. And 
yet, behind his tired eyes burned a stubborn will that refused to die. While others dreamed 
of glory, he dreamed only of surviving tomorrow.

No one noticed him.

No one expected anything from him.

And that was why, when the gate that would change everything finally opened, no one 
realized that the world itself was about to shift.

Because even in an age ruled by hunters, fate still had room for one human to rise from 
nothing—and rewrite the meaning of power itself.
